## Week 2 project for Reproducible Research

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

### Lets load the data
Load the data (i.e. read.csv())
Process/transform the data

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### What is the average daily activity pattern?

Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
    
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Let's impute missing values

The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 

Do these values differ, so were the missing days introducing any bias? 
What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

Note: We use the dataset with the filled-in missing values from here down
    
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. 

Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.
    
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In summary,
